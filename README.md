# Beating Crime with AI

An Exhibit for the I AM AI exhibition.

Developed by [IMAGINARY gGmbH](https://www.imaginary.org) with the assistance of Dr. Janet Chan (UNSW Sydney).

## Editing

Don't modify the index.html file directly. Instead use the [Twine](https://twinery.org/) editor.

Twine has an [online editor](https://twinery.org/2) which allows importing the index.html file and then exporting it
again when you finished your modifications. Images and external dependencies (external JS and CSS files) are not
normally loaded by the online editor but can be used when running the exhibit through a local web server.

## Configuration

Some configuration is possible via the URL query string:

- `hideReferences`: Hide the link to the bibliographic references at the end.
  The references contain links to external web sites which may be undesired.
